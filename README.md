###Python 
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable.
Features in Python
There are many features in Python, some of which are discussed below. 

#1. Easy to code:
Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, JavaScript, Java, etc. 

#2. Free and Open Source:
Python language is freely available at the official website and you can download it from the given download link below click on the Download Python keyword.

#3. Object-Oriented Language:
One of the key features of python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, objects encapsulation, etc.

#4. GUI Programming Support:
Graphical User interfaces can be made using a module such as PyQt5, PyQt4, wxPython, or Tk in python.
PyQt5 is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.

#5. High-Level Language:
Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in python, we do not need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory.

#6. Extensible feature:
Python is an Extensible language. We can write us some Python code into C or C++ language and, we can compile that code in C/C++ language.

#7. Python is Portable language:
Python language is also a portable language. For example, if we have python code for windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.

#8. Python is Integrated language:
Python is also an Integrated language because we can easily integrated python with other languages like c, c++, etc.

#9. Interpreted Language:
Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time. like other languages C, C++, Java, etc. there is no need to compile python code this makes it easier to debug our code. The source code of python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.

#10. Large Standard Library
Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of module and functions, so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.

#11. Dynamically Typed Language:
Python is a dynamically typed language. That means the type (for example- int, double, long, etc.) for a variable is decided at run time not in advance because of this feature we donâ€™t need to specify the type of variable.
